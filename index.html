            <h1>Katherine Stein</h1>
            <h2>Game Designer and Developer</h2>
            <p>I am a fourth-year Game Design and Development major at RIT. I have proficiency in C#, C, and C++, with a solid understanding of Python, Java, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. I am also comfortable using Unity, Unreal Engines 4 and 5, MonoGame, Visual Studio, and Visual Studio Code. Although I have practice with and understanding of level design, web development, AI, and animation, I prefer to focus on the programming aspect of video games. I am very interested in gameplay, and I like making the player movement and controls as fluid and responsive as possible. I like following through, taking ideas, developing them into full-fledged games and find satisfaction in solving problems and learning how things work. In my free time, I enjoy watching video game documentaries and GDC talks. Although I am self-motivated, I prefer working in a team environment, so I can get feedback on how to make my code as efficient and clean as possible.<br><br>Growing up with the Nintendo Wii, DS, and Original Xbox, I loved video games from a young age. I was also very curious as a child and I would take apart electronics with my Dad to see how they work. Even now, I like to find broken consoles or broken electronics and figure out how to fix them myself. I have always enjoyed learning new things and have taught myself how to use Unity, to play guitar and ukulele, and even some programming. I first became interested in the development of video games while on a college break. During this I played two games that changed my perspective from escapist fun to a form of art. Soon after, I submitted my application to RIT for Game Design and Development and found a love for programming and creating experiences for other people to enjoy.</p>

                        the starter weapon. Including particle effects firing and on impact, recoil animations, beam particles, 
                        zoom in when aiming, and aiming towards the crosshair in the center of the screen. I have also 
                        implemented controls for both keyboard and controllers inputs.</p>

                      <h2>Willow's Mansion</h2>
                      <p>In Willow's Mansion, you embody the spirit of Willow, a child who was murdered. Once a kindred spirit regarded warmly by the local townspeople, a traveling party of ghost hunters inadvertently welcomed all sorts of evil into the mansion Willow haunts. You now must use her powers to guide the characters to artifacts that hold the key to Willow’s power while keeping them out of harm’s way. Be careful not to go too far though! Should the adventurers become spooked, they will flee, leaving Willow with no means to purge the evil spirits.</p>

                      <h2>Hero Duo</h2>
                      <p>Hero Duo is a 2D shoot 'em up made in collaboration with the students from Kyoto Computer Gakuin during a 24 hour game jam. In Hero Duo, you can switch between two playable characters - Taro and Eagle - to defeat the legendary Godfoot, a combination of Godzilla and Bigfoot. The background is filled with scenery from Japan and the United States, such as Mt. Fuji with a piece of sushi on top, and the Statue of Liberty with a hamburger in place of the torch. This game was a fun combination of our cultures.</p>

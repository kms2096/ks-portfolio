            <h1>Katherine Stein</h1>
            <h2>Game Designer and Developer</h2>
            <p>I am a Game Design and Development major at RIT, minoring in Computer Science and Creative Writing. I have proficiency in C#, C, and C++, with a solid understanding of Java, HTML, and CSS. I am also comfortable using Unity, Unreal Engines 4 and 5, Monogame, Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, JGRASP, the command line and Linux. Although I have practice with and understanding of level design, web development, AI, and animation, I prefer to focus on the programming aspect of video games. I am very interested in gameplay, and I like making the player movement and controls as fluid and responsive as possible. I like following through and taking ideas and developing them into full-fledged games and find satisfaction in solving problems and learning how things work. In my free time, I enjoy watching video game documentaries and GDC talks. Although I am self-motivated, I prefer working in a team environment, so I can get feedback on how to make my code as efficient and clean as possible.
            <br><br> Growing up with the Nintendo Wii, DS, and Original Xbox, I loved video games from a young age. I was also very curious as a child and I would take apart electronics with my Dad to see how they work. Even now, I like to find broken consoles or broken electronics and figure out how to fix them myself. I have always enjoyed learning new things and have taught myself how to use Unity, to play guitar and ukulele, and even some programming. I first became interested in the development of video games while on a college break. During this I played two games that changed my perspective from escapist fun to a form of art. Soon after, I submitted my application to RIT for Game Design and Development and found a love for programming and creating experiences for other people to enjoy. </p>

                    <h2>Niraya</h2>
                    <p>In this 2D hack and slash platformer, you play as a fierce warrior that has to fight her way through a dangerous forest filled with monsters in order to rescue her pet dog. Core gameplay elements include jumping, attacking, dashing through enemies and death. Should you perish, you get one more chance to get to your dog before having to start over. Once you die, the world changes around you, the forest gets darker, and previously killed enemies come back in the form of skeletons.</p>

                    <h2>Currently working on:</h2>
                    <p>I am currently working on this third person shooter in Unreal Engine 4. I still have to work on the enemies, levels, health, and weapons. From this project, I have gained a basic understanding of Blueprints and blend spaces. I have finalized the animations for the main character and worked on the starter weapon. Including particle effects firing and on impact, recoil animations, beam particles, zoom in when aiming, and aiming towards the crosshair in the center of the screen. I have also implemented controls for both keyboard and controllers inputs.</p>

                            <h2>Description:</h2>
                            <p>You are home for the summer and your parents are out of town for the weekend so decide to throw a welcome home party for college students. Things did not get THAT out of hand as you recall. Until your alarm begins to go off the next day and you see a text message, your parents are on their way back from the airport! Get rid of the evidence of the best night of your life. Rush around between rooms and clean up the messes left behind by partygoers and be prepared to welcome your parents home.      </p><br>
        
                            <h2>Development:</h2>
                            <p>Development on this game was started after signing up for the Technica 2021 hackathon with two other friends. The theme for the hackathon was "Welcome Home." At this point I had virtually no experience with working in a collaborative setting and only a few months working in C#. This hackathon took place over the course of 24 hours. One of the things I worked on was player movement, I also took the drawings of the house and made them into a level including adding obstacles and piecing the rooms together. I also added the ability to move between rooms.
                            </p><br>
        
                            <h2>Challenges:</h2>
                            <p>The first challenge we ran into was figuring out how to use Unity as a team, being able to pull each other's changes and everyone staying up to date proved to be a challenge initially. Once we figured this out, the next problem I ran into was moving the character between rooms. My original code checked the character's position and checked if it matched the collider for the door. This did not work since the coordinates of the character were in the center of the sprite, so the character would never trigger the collider. After talking to my team members, we figured out that we needed to check the X and Y coordinates and add the character's radius to it. Once we added the radius to the coordinates, we were able to change rooms.
                            </p><br>
                            
                            <h2>What went well:</h2>
                            <p>This was a good first experience working in a group, since everyone was working together and helped each other when there were problems. Working in a group together was one of the best experiences I have had. Even though we did not win, I thoroughly enjoyed working together with my friends and making something at the end on the day.</p>
